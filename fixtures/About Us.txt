We maximize the Total Good, not the bottom line. As a nonprofit, our only "fiducial responsibility" is to our donors, volunteers, and the commons. When we talk about global optimization we really mean global. Humanity has embarked on the positive sum game of developing intelligent machines, and Total Good is going contribute to the win.

We believe that the most valuable technology for advancing the human race together is Machine Intelligence. A fish may feed, a fishing rod may feed for much longer, but a robot that farms fish... now that would empower humanity to reach our greatest potential.

Our goal is to ensure that the underprivileged have access to state of the art Machine Intelligence technology for free. This will help ensure that the "control problem" is solved by social evolutionary dynamics. Only the most social and cooperative machines will survive an propagate themselves throughout the world.

<h2>Join Us!</h2>
<p>If you're passionate about using Machine Intelligence to add to the good in the world, we can help! Helping you build a tool, dashboard, or database, grows our open source code base and our Machine Intelligence "training set". Together we can increase the total good, bit by bit.</p>
<p>We are developers, designers, engineers, economists, communicators, podcasters, bloggers, videographers, and statisticians who care about more than just targeted advertising or financial trading bots. For example, we're working with <a href="hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a> this summer to increase political campaign <a href="ballot.hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a>financial transparency</a>, mining the transaction data for Portland Oregon and the rest of the state. And we're building an automated learning tool to allow public servants to build predictive models without having to learn statistics or computer science.</p>
<p>And we don't hold back. Everything we do is open source, open data, open science. All IP is donated to the public domain or licensed to the public free of charge.</p>
