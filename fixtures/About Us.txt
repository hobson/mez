We maximize the Total Good, not the bottom line. As a nonprofit, our only "fiducial responsibility" is to our donors, volunteers, and the commons. When we talk about global optimization we really mean global. Humanity has embarked on the positive sum game of developing intelligent machines, and Total Good is going contribute to the win.

We believe that the most valuable technology for advancing the human race together is Machine Intelligence. A fish may feed, a fishing rod may feed for much longer, but a robot that farms fish... now that would empower humanity to reach our greatest potential.

Our goal is to ensure that the underprivileged have access to state of the art Machine Intelligence technology for free. This will help ensure that the "control problem" is solved by social evolutionary dynamics. Only the most social and cooperative machines will survive an propagate themselves throughout the world.
