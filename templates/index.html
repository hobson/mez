<h2>Join Us!</h2>
<p>If you're passionate about using Machine Intelligence to add to the good in the world, we can help! Helping you build a tool, dashboard, or database, grows our open source code base and our Machine Intelligence "training set". Together we can increase the total good, bit by bit.</p>
<p>We are developers, designers, engineers, economists, communicators, podcasters, bloggers, videographers, and statisticians who care about more than just targeted advertising or financial trading bots. For example, we're working with <a href="hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a> this summer to increase political campaign <a href="ballot.hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a>financial transparency</a>, mining the transaction data for Portland Oregon and the rest of the state. And we're building an automated learning tool to allow public servants to build predictive models without having to learn statistics or computer science.</p>
<p>And we don't hold back. Everything we do is open source, open data, open science. All IP is donated to the public domain or licensed to the public free of charge.</p>
